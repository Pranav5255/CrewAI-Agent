```
# src/latest_ai_development/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
from crewai.agents.agent_builder.base_agent import BaseAgent
from typing import List

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
  """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

  agents: List[BaseAgent]
  tasks: List[Task]

  @agent
  def researcher(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
      config=self.agents_config['researcher'], # type: ignore[index]
      verbose=True,
      tools=[SerperDevTool()]
    )

  @agent
  def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(

      verbose=True
    )

  @task
  def research_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
      config=self.tasks_config['research_task'], # type: ignore[index]
    )

  @task
  def reporting_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
      config=self.tasks_config['reporting_task'], # type: ignore[index]
      output_file='output/report.md' # This is the file that will be contain the final report.
    )

      tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
      process=Process.sequential,
      verbose=True,
    )
```
**6) [Optional] Add before and after crew functions**

# src/latest_ai_development/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task, before_kickoff, after_kickoff
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
  """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

  @before_kickoff
  def before_kickoff_function(self, inputs):
    print(f"Before kickoff function with inputs: {inputs}")
    return inputs # You can return the inputs or modify them as needed

  @after_kickoff
  def after_kickoff_function(self, result):
    print(f"After kickoff function with result: {result}")
    return result # You can return the result or modify it as needed

  # ... remaining code
```
**7) Set your environment variables**
Before running your crew, make sure you have the following keys set as environment variables in your .env file:
- A Serper.dev API key: SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
- The configuration for your choice of model, such as an API key. See the LLM setup guide to learn how to configure models from any provider.
