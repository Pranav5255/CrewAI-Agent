from crewai.agents.agent_builder.base_agent import BaseAgent
from typing import List

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
  """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

  agents: List[BaseAgent]
  tasks: List[Task]

  @agent
  def researcher(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
      config=self.agents_config['researcher'], # type: ignore[index]
      verbose=True,
      tools=[SerperDevTool()]
    )

  @agent
